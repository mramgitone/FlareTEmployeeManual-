        <h1>Section 7 — Employee Acknowledgement Form</h1>
        <p>I have received a copy of the Employee Handbook (“Handbook”) of <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />. The Handbook describes important information about my employment at <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />, and I understand that it is my responsibility to read and comply with the policies contained in this Handbook and any revisions made to them. I understand that my failure to comply with any of the policies in this Handbook may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. I understand that I should consult my supervisor regarding any questions not answered in the Handbook.</p>
        <p>I understand <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> has the right, in its sole discretion, to amend, alter, supplement, change, or revise any such rules, regulations, or policies at any time without advance notice.</p>
        <p>Since the information, policies and benefits described are necessarily subject to change, I acknowledge that revisions to the Handbook may occur. All such changes will be communicated through proper notices, and I understand that revised information may replace, modify, or eliminate existing policies.</p>
        <p>I understand that nothing in this Handbook nor any policies of <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> are intended to create a contract of employment. I understand that my employment at <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> is at-will and may be terminated at any time with or without cause or notice by <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> or me. I further understand that the at-will nature of my employment cannot be modified, either expressly or by implication, including any statements, comments, or actions by any representative, supervisor of <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />, except the General Manager. Any such modification by <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> will be effective only if in writing, and signed and dated by me (the employee) and by my supervisor.</p>
