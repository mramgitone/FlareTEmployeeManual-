        <h1>Attendance</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> expects regular and timely attendance from all employees, including those on Restricted Duty due to an on-the-job injury. Excessive absences and tardiness burden your co-workers and will be a significant factor in your continued employment, performance appraisals, salary reviews, and in evaluating advancement opportunities.</p>
        <p>Absence is the failure to report for work or to remain at work as scheduled. It includes late arrivals and early departures as well as absence for an entire day.</p>
        <p>The company recognizes there may be justifiable causes for absence on occasion and, therefore, adopts a system of progressive discipline. Absenteeism will result in a series of warnings and ultimately termination from employment as follows if there is no improvement:</p>

        <p>An employee who will be absent for more than one day is expected to contact his or her supervisor daily unless other arrangements have been made. A doctor’s statement may be required for documentation. For unapproved absences, late arrivals, or early departures for reasons other than a medical condition, the employee will continue to accrue occurrences in accordance with the list above for each day the employee is absent, arrives late, or leaves early from a shift.</p>
        <p>All absences for reasons other than unexpected illness, injury, or other emergency must be scheduled and approved in advance with your supervisor and will be counted as a vacation day. On those occasions when you are unable to report to work due to unexpected illness, injury, or other emergency, you must personally notify your supervisor two (2) hours before your scheduled starting time. If your supervisor is not available, notify the supervisor on duty.</p>
        <p>An employee is expected to obtain approval from his or her supervisor to leave the work location for reasons other than lunch, breaks, or conducting department business.</p>
        <p>Two (2) consecutive scheduled workdays of absence without proper notification will be treated as a voluntary resignation. Employees who receive two (2) final written warnings or two (2) no call/no shows within a twelve (12)-month period or two (2) occurrences within their first ninety (90) days of employment will be subject to termination.</p>
