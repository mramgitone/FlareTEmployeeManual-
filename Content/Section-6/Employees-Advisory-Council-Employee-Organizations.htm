        <h1>Employees Advisory Council and Employee Organizations</h1>
        <p>The Employees Advisory Council (EAC) is the oﬃcial voice of <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> employees. The EAC was established by the company to provide a continuing medium through which employees may contribute their advice and suggestions for the improvement of the career merit system and other aspects of the company. Members of the EAC represent designated groups of employees and serve to assist with employee issues.</p>
        <p>The council serves as a link between employees and company oﬃcials and meets regularly with the <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" /> director and the company executive. In an eﬀort to contribute to employee well-being and morale, the EAC may sponsor voluntary recreational or other activities.</p>
        <p>Other employee associations, operating in an unoﬃcial capacity, represent personnel in various agencies. The organizations’ activities range from charitable, community, and social functions to assisting members with job- related concerns. You have the right to join or refrain from membership in these organizations.</p>
