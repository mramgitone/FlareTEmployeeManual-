        <h1>Harassment</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> will not tolerate harassment of its employees, whether committed by a fellow employee, a member of management, or a visitor to our workplace, such as a vendor, or customer. Due to the company’s commitment to creating a positive working environment for its employees, all supervisors undergo diversity and anti-harassment training. All employees are responsible for ensuring that the workplace is free from harassment, especially when such conduct is based upon gender, race, age, religion, national origin or ancestry, disability, or other protected categories. This includes sexual harassment, gender harassment, and harassment due to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Other harassment includes harassment due to physical or mental disability, marital status, age, sexual orientation, veteran, current or future military status, or any other basis protected by federal, state, or local law or ordinance or regulation. All employees, including supervisors, will be subject to disciplinary action for any act of harassment they commit, up to and including termination from employment.</p>
        <p>Harassment is defined as verbal, visual, or physical conduct that belittles, demeans, or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual for reasons including, but not limited to, his or her gender, race, religion, color, national origin, age, sexual preference, or disability, or that of his or her relatives, friends, or associates, and that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.</li>
            <li>Has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance.</li>
            <li>Otherwise adversely affects an individual’s employment opportunities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples of prohibited unlawful harassment include, but are not limited to, any of the following when they relate to any of the protected characteristics listed above:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Verbal conduct, such as derogatory jokes, comments, or slurs.</li>
            <li>Visual conduct, such as derogatory and/or sexually oriented posters, photography, cartoons, drawings, or gestures.</li>
            <li>Physical conduct, such as unwanted touching, blocking normal movement, interfering with work, or assault.</li>
            <li>Unwanted sexual advances or invitations, threats, or demands to submit to sexual requests as a condition of continued employment, or to avoid some other loss, and offers of employment benefits in return for sexual favors.</li>
            <li>Retaliation for having reported or threatened to report harassment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you believe you have been the subject of harassment or if you have knowledge of harassment of a co-worker, you should let the other person know that his or behavior is unwelcome. You are free to try to resolve the problem with the other person or persons. Otherwise, immediately bring it to the attention of your supervisor. If for any reason you do not feel comfortable discussing the matter with your supervisor, contact <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" /> or any member of management whom you feel comfortable in approaching. All reports will be promptly investigated in as confidential a manner as possible. Based upon the findings of the investigation, the company will take prompt and appropriate action to remedy any violations of this policy. Offenses by vendors, clients, or customers will be handled through the offender and his or her company, if appropriate.</p>
        <p>No employee who brings a good faith report of harassment to the attention of the company will suffer retaliation or other adverse employment action as a consequence. Any employee, including supervisors, who is found to have retaliated against an employee who reported a violation of this policy in good faith will be subject to discipline up to and including termination from employment. It is important for employees to report incidents of harassment, because without your assistance, violations could go undetected and unremedied.</p>
        <p>You are encouraged to use the company’s procedure as outlined above for reporting any incidents of harassment so that complaints can be quickly and fairly resolved. However, you should also be aware that the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the State Department of Fair Employment and Housing investigate and prosecute complaints of prohibited harassment in employment. If you think you have been harassed or that you have been retaliated against for making a complaint, you may file a complaint with the appropriate agency. You may contact <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" /> for further information.</p>
