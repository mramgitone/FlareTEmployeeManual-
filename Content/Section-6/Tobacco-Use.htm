        <h1>Tobacco Use</h1>
        <p>Tobacco use of any kind may not be used in a manner that interferes with productivity or otherwise creates an unprofessional atmosphere. In the interest of everyoneâ€™s safety, health, and comfort, smoking has been restricted to specified areas. Smoking is not permitted in the break and lunchrooms, conference rooms, hallways, offices, docks, shops, guardhouses, trailers/bobtails, restrooms, dispatch and dock offices, flammable areas, dorms, and company vehicles designated as non-smoking. Smoking breaks that are excessive in frequency or length will be treated as an attendance issue. Smokeless tobacco users must utilize non-transparent containers that will not spill if accidentally knocked over. Smokeless tobacco may not be spit into or on any other surface, including but not limited to trash cans, sinks, or trailers.</p>
