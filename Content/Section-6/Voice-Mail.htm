        <h1>Voice Mail</h1>
        <p>Our voice mail system is designed to increase productivity. You should always treat employees with respect when leaving messages. Do not leave curt or last-minute messages for anyone. Do not use the voice mail system to hide from co-workers or customers. If you are at your desk, you are generally expected to answer your telephone.</p>
        <p>The voice mail system is not to be used for personal messages such as soliciting contributions for your favorite charity, arranging for after-work get-togethers, or the like.</p>
        <p>Messages may be randomly monitored to determine whether any outsiders are using the system, or whether any violations of company policy have occurred.</p>
