        <h1>Inclement Weather</h1>
        <p>At times, emergencies such as severe weather, fires, or power failures can disrupt company operations. The decision to close the office will be made by the Management. When the decision is made to close the office, employees will receive official notification from their supervisor.</p>
        <p>Employees are expected to report to work during severe weather conditions if <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> does not declare an emergency closure. During inclement weather periods, employees are responsible for contacting the company regarding opening or closing hours. Non-exempt employees who are unable to report because of weather conditions will be granted an authorized unpaid absence. Non-exempt employees who are late due to weather conditions will be provided a chance to make up their missed time, if work schedules and conditions permit.</p>
