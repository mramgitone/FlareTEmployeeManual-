        <h1>Driving on the Job</h1>
        <p>Certain employees operate company vehicles to perform their jobs, or while representing <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> on oﬃcial business. You must hold a valid driver’s license to drive a company vehicle. If you operate a company vehicle on a regular basis as part of your job, you must sign a release authorizing the company to obtain your driving record transcript from the Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>
        <p>While driving, you are required to obey all traﬃc laws and drive defensively. The driver and the front seat passengers of a vehicle are required by law to use safety lap belts and shoulder harnesses. For a complete listing of driver safety requirement please contact the Risk Management Division.</p>
        <p>There is an Accident Report Kit in the glove compartment of each company vehicle. The kit includes forms and procedures to be followed if an accident occurs.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> does not insure employees’ personal vehicles for damages sustained while used for company business. As a result, when possible, it is strongly encouraged that vehicles from the company’s pool be used to conduct business. In the event of an accident, contact your own insurance company. You are covered under a company liability policy, but only for auto liability in excess of your own policy coverage. Fill out the company Vehicle Accident Report form and submit all copies to the company claims manager in the Risk Management Division. The use of motorcycles for company business travel, with the exception of security oﬃcers in the performance of their duties, is strongly discouraged.</p>
