        <h1>Weapons</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> prohibits all persons who enter company premises from carrying a handgun, firearm, or prohibited weapon of any kind, regardless of whether the person is licensed to carry the weapon or not. This policy applies to all company employees, contract and temporary employees, visitors on company property, and customers on company property, regardless of whether they are licensed to carry a concealed weapon. The only exceptions to this policy are police officers, security guards, or other persons who have been given consent by the company to carry a weapon on the premises. Additionally, employees may not transport weapons in company-owned or leased commercial motor vehicles or vehicles used to perform work at a terminal.</p>
        <p>Prohibited weapons include any form of weapon or explosive restricted under local, state, or federal regulation. This includes all firearms, knives with blades over three inches in length, or other weapons covered by law. Legal chemical dispensing devices, such as pepper sprays, which are sold for personal protection, are not covered by this policy. Company property covered by this policy includes, without limitation, all company-owned or leased buildings and surrounding areas, such as sidewalks, walkways, driveways, and parking lots under the companyâ€™s ownership or control. Company-owned or leased commercial motor vehicles and vehicles used to perform work at a terminal are covered by this policy at all times regardless of whether they are on company property at the time.</p>
        <p>The company reserves the right to conduct searches of any person, vehicle, or object that enters onto company property in order to enforce this policy. Items that may be searched include, but are not limited to, lockers, desks, purses, briefcases, baggage, toolboxes, lunch sacks, clothing, vehicles parked on company property, and any other item in which a weapon may be hidden. Company management or local authorities may conduct searches. To the extent the search is requested by company management and the employee is present, the employee may refuse the search. However, such refusal can result in termination from employment for refusal to cooperate.</p>
        <p>If an employee is unsure whether an item is covered by this policy, please contact your supervisor. Employees are responsible for making sure that any item they possess is not prohibited by this policy.</p>
