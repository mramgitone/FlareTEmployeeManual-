        <h1>Alternative Dispute Resolution</h1>
        <p>Conﬂicts naturally arise in the workplace. They may stem from diﬀerences in communication styles, work styles, cultural frames of reference or values, preferences regarding the work environment, supervisory styles, or misunderstandings related to roles and responsibilities.</p>
        <p>To oﬀer support in maintaining eﬀective, collaborative relationships among co-workers, to promote positive and productive workplace behaviors, and to encourage the use of conﬂict resolution techniques, <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> has established the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Program. The program oﬀers <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> employees an alternative means of addressing and resolving workplace complaints. “Workplace complaints” include complaints covered by the company’s grievance procedure as well as disputes or disagreements not covered by the grievance procedure. Mediation is the primary dispute resolution process used. It is a conﬁdential and voluntary process in which the parties in conﬂict mutually agree to meet face to face to discuss their situation and look for a solution with the assistance of a trained, impartial third party.</p>
        <p>During mediation, all parties agree to discuss issues openly, honestly, and conﬁdentially in a courteous and respectful environment. Trained mediators guide the discussion and help the parties develop the solution themselves. Requests for mediation must be processed through the ADR Program Coordinator who will determine the appropriateness of the issues for mediation and the willingness of the parties to explore a resolution to their conﬂict. To request mediation or to obtain more information, contact the oﬃce of the ADR Program at 555-555-5555.</p>
