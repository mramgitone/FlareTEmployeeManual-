        <h1>Violence in the Workplace</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> has developed this policy for workplace violence because we recognize workplace violence as a growing national problem that needs to be addressed by all employers. In accordance with this policy, acts or threats of physical violence, including intimidation, harassment, and coercion that involve or affect the company, anyone involved in the companyâ€™s operations, or occur on company property will not be tolerated.</p>
        <p>Acts or threats of violence include conduct, which is severe, offensive, or intimidating enough to alter the employment conditions at the company or to create a hostile, abusive, or intimidating work environment for one or more employees. Examples of workplace violence include but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Threats or acts of violence occurring on company premises, regardless of the relationship between the company and the parties involved in the incident.</li>
            <li>Threats or acts of violence occurring off company premises involving someone who is acting as a representative of the company.</li>
            <li>Threats or acts of violence occurring off company premises involving an employee of the company if the threats or acts affect the company's legitimate interests.</li>
            <li>Threats or acts resulting in the conviction of an employee, an agent of the company, or an individual performing services for the company on a contract or temporary basis under any criminal code provision relating to violence or threats of violence that adversely affect the company's legitimate interests and goals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples of conduct, which may be considered threats or acts of violence include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hitting or shoving an individual.</li>
            <li>Threatening an individual or his/her family, friends, associates, or property with harm.</li>
            <li>The intentional destruction or threat of destruction of company property.</li>
            <li>Harassing or threatening phone calls.</li>
            <li>Harassing surveillance or stalking.</li>
            <li>The suggestion or insinuation that violence is appropriate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Violation of this policy by any individual on company property, by an individual acting as a representative of the company while off company property, or by an individual acting off company property when his or her actions affect company business interests, will lead to disciplinary action up to and including termination, and/or legal action, as appropriate. No provision of this policy shall alter the at-will nature of the employment relationship at the company.</p>
