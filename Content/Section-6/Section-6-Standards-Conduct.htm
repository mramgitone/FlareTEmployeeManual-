        <h1>Section 6 — Standards of Conduct</h1>
        <p>This section outlines the standards of conduct and corrective action at <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />. </p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> requires its employees to conduct themselves with integrity, show respect for their fellow employees, and comply with Company policies. The standards discussed in the policy are not all inclusive. Check with your supervisor for safety and conduct policies specific to your department. In any event, the company reserves the right to discipline any employee, up to and including termination, for any act or omission that the company deems in its sole discretion to be contrary to the company’s interests. Nothing is intended to alter an employee’s “at-will” employment status.</p>
