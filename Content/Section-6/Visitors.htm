        <h1>Visitors</h1>
        <p>To provide for the safety and security of employees, visitors, and the facilities at <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />, only authorized visitors are allowed in the workplace. Restricting unauthorized visitors helps ensure security, decreases insurance liability, protects confidential information, safeguards employee welfare, and avoids potential distractions and disturbances. Therefore, all visitors should be requested to check in at the terminal reception area or front office. Non-employee visitors must have approved business reasons to be permitted on company premises and must be escorted by a designated company representative.</p>
        <p>Visitors must sign in with the receptionist. Visitors, including employeesâ€™ family members, must be escorted at all times while on company property. Children are not allowed onto docks or other locations outside the terminal office areas. Anyone not accompanied should be assisted to their company contact. Unaccompanied strangers should be immediately reported to the Terminal Manager or security personnel. All visitors are subject to being searched for weapons, drugs, drug paraphernalia, or other contraband.</p>
        <p>Where visitor identification badges are issued, visitors are required to wear them at all times. Anyone not wearing a badge should be asked to wait in the reception area or front office and should be escorted to that location. All visitors must enter through the main entrance.</p>
        <p>The company cooperates with law enforcement agencies, including Customs Agents. Direct any such individuals to your supervisor. The company does not allow private process servers onto company premises to serve papers on employees.</p>
        <p>Unauthorized use, removal of, and/or destruction of any property (i.e., tools, equipment, personal property, records, and confidential information) is prohibited.</p>
