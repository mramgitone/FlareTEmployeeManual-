        <h1>Non-Union Status</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> is a non-union company. It prefers to deal directly with its employees, without the need of a third party. The company believes that its employees can convey and address any issues that may arise with the company better than a union could. The involvement of unions creates delays in addressing issues as they arise and unnecessary expenses, including union dues paid by the employee. All employees are free to deal directly with the company without any outside party coming between them.</p>
