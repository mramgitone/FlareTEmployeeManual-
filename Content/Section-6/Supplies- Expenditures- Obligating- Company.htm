        <h1>Supplies, Expenditures, and Obligating the Company</h1>
        <p>Only authorized persons may purchase supplies in the name of <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />. No employee whose regular duties do not include purchasing shall incur any expense on behalf of the company or bind the company by any promise or representation without written approval.</p>
        <p>Expenses incurred by an employee must have prior approval by a supervisor. Reimbursements under $25.00 will be included in the employeeâ€™s next regular paycheck. An example of such an expense would include mileage. If the amount is more than $25.00, the reimbursement request will be processed like an invoice. All completed reimbursement request forms should be turned in to the Accounts Payable/Payroll Department.</p>
