        <h1>Corrective Action</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> holds each of its employees to certain work rules and standards of conduct. When an employee deviates from these rules and standards, the company expects the employee’s supervisor to take corrective action.</p>
        <p>Corrective action at the company is progressive. That means that the action taken in response to a rule infraction or violation of standards typically follows a pattern increasing in seriousness until the infraction or violation is corrected.</p>
        <p>The usual sequence of corrective actions includes an oral warning, a written warning, probation, and finally termination. In deciding which initial corrective action would be appropriate, the supervisor will consider the seriousness of the infraction, the circumstances surrounding the matter, and the employee’s previous record.</p>
        <p>The company considers certain rule infractions and violations of standards as grounds for immediate termination. These include but are not limited to theft in any form, insubordinate behavior, vandalism or destruction of company property, being on company property during non-business hours, the use of company equipment and/or company vehicles without prior authorization, untruthfulness about personal work history, skills, or training, divulging company business practices, and misrepresentations of the company to a customer, a prospective customer, the general public, or an employee.</p>
        <p>All discipline is documented in your personnel file.</p>
