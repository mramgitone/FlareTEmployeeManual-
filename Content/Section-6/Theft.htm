        <h1>Theft</h1>
        <p>Internal theft is a serious problem for many businesses. Although taking small items of company property may seem inconsequential, the cumulative effect can be very large. Losses from theft immediately affect our ability to increase salaries and can jeopardize the profitability of the company.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> will not tolerate property theft of any type. We consider property theft to include the unauthorized use of company services or facilities or the taking of any company property for personal use.</p>
        <p>Violators of this policy will be subjected to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</p>
