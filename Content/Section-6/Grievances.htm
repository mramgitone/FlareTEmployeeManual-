        <h1>Grievances</h1>
        <p>If you encounter a problem concerning a condition of employment or treatment by management or other employees, bring the matter to the attention of your supervisor. If you are unable to resolve the matter to your satisfaction after informal discussion, you may investigate the possibility of using the company’s grievance procedure. Access to the grievance procedure (except for discrimination complaints) is limited to merit employees who have completed their initial twelve (12)-month probationary period.</p>
        <p>The grievance procedure consists of a series of meetings with various levels of management in an attempt to resolve the complaint. Grievances that are not handled to your satisfaction within your department can go to the Civil Service Commission for hearing.</p>
        <p>Not all matters are covered by the grievance procedure. Some non-grievable issues include the contents of personnel regulations and ordinances and the setting of wages, salaries, and beneﬁts.</p>
        <p>Timeliness of ﬁling complaints is critical. In most cases, the grievance must be initiated within twenty (20) business days of the event. Instructions on the grievance procedure, as well as the appropriate forms, are available online and from the Employee Relations Division of <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" /> or the Oﬃce of Equity Programs.</p>
        <p>Discrimination complaints are ﬁled with the Oﬃce of Equity Programs. Merit employees, including those who are probationary, are eligible to grieve discrimination based on age, sex, sexual harassment, race, color, religion, national origin, disability, marital status, and political or union aﬃliation. These complaints may also be ﬁled with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).</p>
