        <h1>Conflict of Interest Policy</h1>
        <p>Employees of <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> are expected to conduct the business of <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> with total objectivity. A conflict of interest may exist where an individual stands to gain or lose personally from a  business decision of <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />; or where an employee or member of his or her immediate family has an interest, direct or indirect, in an entity dealing with <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />, and the interest is of such an extent or nature that his or her decision might be affected or determined by it; or an employee serves in an advisory, consulting, technical, or management capacity for any non-affiliated business organization that does significant business with or is a competitor of the company. If a conflict of interest or appearance of conflict is unavoidable, an employee should inform his or her supervisor immediately.</p>
        <p>To minimize the possibility of a conflict of interest, each employee is required to inform his or her supervisor of all other jobs the employee has while working at <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> and the hours worked for his or her other employers. The appearance of a conflict of interest may be just as damaging to the company’s reputation as a real conflict. All employees are expected to take an objective look at their actions from time to time to determine whether a reasonable observer would have any grounds to believe a conflict of interest exists.</p>
        <p>Conflicts of interests or unethical behavior may take many forms including, but not limited to, the acceptance of gifts or compensation from competitors, vendors, potential vendors, or customers of <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />. Gifts may only be accepted if they have a nominal retail value, but employees are not to accept any form of compensation.</p>
        <p>Employees are prohibited from engaging in financial participation, outside employment, or any other business undertaking that is competitive with, or prejudicial to, the best interests of <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />. Employees may not use proprietary and/or confidential information for personal gain or to the company’s detriment, nor may they use the company’s assets or labor for personal use.</p>
        <p>Other employment in and of itself is allowed unless the employee’s work with company is adversely affected. However, employment or any involvement with a competitor is considered a conflict of interest and is prohibited.</p>
        <p>If an employee or someone with whom the employee has a close personal relationship has a financial or employment relationship with a competitor, vendor, potential vendor, or customer of <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />, the employee must disclose this fact in writing to <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" />. <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> will determine what course of action must be taken to resolve any conflict it believes may exist, up to and including requesting the employee to tender his/her resignation. <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> has sole discretion to determine whether such a conflict of interest exists.</p>
        <p>Employees are encouraged to seek assistance from their supervisor with any legal or ethical concerns. However, the company realizes this may not always be possible. As a result, employees may contact <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" /> to report anything that they feel they cannot discuss with their supervisor.</p>
