        <h1>Telephone</h1>
        <p>Employees do not have a right of privacy regarding telephone calls made using company equipment. In order to ensure that the telephone is available for customers’ business purposes, the frequency and length of personal telephone calls must be limited. Employees may make personal phone calls from designated phones or their personal cellular phones during lunch and break times. The privilege of making outgoing phone calls during working hours, including calls made on a personal cellular phone, is not to be abused. Long distance calls may not be made from company phones without permission.</p>
        <p>For purposes of this policy, communications through two-way radios will be treated the same as cellular telephone calls. No employee is to engage in the use of a cellular phone for business or personal purposes while operating a commercial motor vehicle, unless the phone is equipped and used with a hands-free device, and even in those instances, the driver should find a “safe haven” to stop the commercial motor vehicle as soon as possible for the duration of the phone conversation. Calls should be made by the driver when the commercial motor vehicle being operated by him or her is not in motion.</p>
