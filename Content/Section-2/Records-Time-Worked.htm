        <h1>Records of Time Worked</h1>
        <p>All hourly employees must keep accurate records of their work time by scanning in the time clock system provided by company. This means that you should clock in at the start of your shift, clock out at the beginning of a meal break or whenever you leave work for personal business, clock in when you return from your meal break or personal business, and clock out at the end of your shift. Employees are not permitted to work before their scheduled start time, unless a supervisor has approved it in advance.</p>
        <p>Employees must never punch in or out for another employee. Any employee who falsifies his or her own time or who punches in or out for another employee will be subject to discipline up to and including immediate termination. If you make an error on your own time or mistakenly scan for another employee, contact your supervisor immediately.</p>
        <p>Employees are not allowed to work additional hours unless a supervisor has approved it in advance. Each employeeâ€™s time record should be accurately recorded to reflect all time worked. Under no circumstances should an employee work off the clock, and any such request from a supervisor should be reported to <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" /> immediately.</p>
        <p>P&amp;D drivers are expected to maintain manifests that accurately reflect the hours they work. When required under federal regulations, line drivers, and P&amp;D drivers are expected to also maintain logbooks to accurately reflect the hours worked and miles driven.</p>
