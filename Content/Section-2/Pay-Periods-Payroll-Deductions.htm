        <p>The company will deduct amounts required by law, such as those for federal income tax and Social Security (FICA), or those ordered by a court, such as garnishment of wages. The company will also deduct amounts authorized by you in writing, such as for insurance costs, charitable deductions, employee purchases, and other fees. The company cannot authorize advances on paychecks or loans to employees.</p>
        <p>The company recommends and encourages its employees to utilize the convenience of direct deposit of paychecks, which allows an employee immediate access to those funds. The company will deposit your paycheck into one (1) to three (3) checking and/or savings accounts of your choice. Direct deposit will begin approximately two (2) to three (3) pay periods after receipt of the authorization form. If depositing in multiple checking accounts, a new direct deposit form is required for each account.</p>
        <p>If a paycheck is lost or stolen, notify <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" /> immediately. The company may ask the employee to wait a reasonable amount of time to see if the check clears the bank. If it does not, the company will issue a new check.</p>
