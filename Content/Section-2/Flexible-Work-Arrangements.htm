        <h1>Flexible Work Arrangements</h1>
        <p>There are several work arrangements that may be available for some positions to allow a better work/life balance.</p>
        <p><b>Alternate Work Schedules –</b> Some jobs may allow early or late start time or working longer hours on fewer days.</p>
        <p><b>Telework –</b> Some jobs may allow employees to work at home or another location during normal work hours instead of commuting to the main worksite. The most common telework arrangement is one to two days per pay period.</p>
        <p><b>Job Sharing –</b> Some jobs may allow an arrangement where two workers share the responsibilities of one full-time job. Employees may split each day or week, split the pay period, or work alternate days, as long as each employee is scheduled to work 40 hours each pay period. Beneﬁts (such as leave and holidays) are prorated between the two employees.</p>
