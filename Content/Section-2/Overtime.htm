        <h1>Overtime</h1>
        <p>Overtime may be required as necessary to satisfy the needs of our customers or the requirements of our business. Overtime is paid to hourly/non-exempt employees only. All overtime must be approved in advance by your supervisor and noted on the time reporting system. Holidays, personal leave, and other personal absences will not be counted as working hours when computing overtime pay. Overtime compensation will be one and one-half (1 Â½) times the employee's regular pay rate and will not include any special form of compensation or bonuses.</p>
