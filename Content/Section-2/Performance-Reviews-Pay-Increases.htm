        <h1>Performance Reviews and Pay Increases</h1>
        <p>Performance reviews and planning sessions are designed for the supervisor and the employee to discuss his or her current job tasks, encourage and recognize attributes, and discuss positive, purposeful approaches for meeting work-related goals. Together, the employee and supervisor discuss ways in which the employee can accomplish goals or learn new skills. The planning sessions are designed for the employee and his or her supervisor to make and agree on new goals, skills, and areas for improvement.</p>
        <p>Supervisors conduct performance reviews on an annual basis. Supervisors may conduct informal performance reviews and planning sessions more often if they choose. Supervisors conduct reviews of probationary employees at the end of their probationary period.</p>
        <p>Merit increases are dependent on both employee and company performance, and are within the company’s sole discretion.</p>
        <p>If you receive a promotion, it may result in a change in your performance pay increase.</p>
        <p>A special or annual evaluation for an employee may result in the supervisor requiring a performance plan, and/or an additional probationary period due to deficiencies in that employee’s performance. Such a performance plan will be in writing, setting forth certain standards and goals that the employee will be expected to meet, and will specify the length of time for the additional probationary period. Both the supervisor and the employee will sign the performance plan before it is implemented.</p>
