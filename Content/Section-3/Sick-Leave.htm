        <h1>Sick Leave</h1>
        <p>Sick leave benefits provide income protection in the event you become ill or disabled. Full-time employees will begin accruing five (5) days sick leave after one (1) year of employment. Sick leave payment is calculated based on your base hourly rate, exclusive of overtime and bonuses. Employees are eligible to use sick leave as it is accrued. If all sick leave is not used at the end of the year, up to three (3) days will be carried over to the next year up to a maximum of ten (10) days.</p>
        <p>Accrued sick leave is to be used in the event of illness, disability, and medical appointments, and in conjunction with applicable federal or state leave provisions. To receive sick pay, you must notify your supervisor on the first day of absence and each subsequent day.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> reserves the right to require written certification as to the bona fide nature of an illness or injury from an attending physician, and/or a release from the physician to return to your normal duties. Unused sick leave will not be paid upon termination.</p>
