        <h1>Health, Dental, Vision, and Prescription Drug Insurance Plan</h1>
        <p>Full-time employees are eligible to participate in the company’s health, dental, vision, and prescription drug insurance program after completing ninety (90) days of employment in a full-time classification. Participation in the company’s health, dental, vision, and prescription drug insurance program is conditioned on the eligible employee paying a percentage of the costs for the insurance coverage. Details of these benefits are provided in the Health Plan’s Summary Plan Description. Current cost information may be obtained from your supervisor or the <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" /> department. Employees on a leave of absence may also be subject to additional requirements for participation, subject to applicable federal and state laws. Please contact <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" /> for additional information regarding benefits for employees on leave.</p>
        <p>One of the many benefits of working in a medical office is access to medical care. <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> will write-off 100% of employee medical expenses incurred in our office. The company will also write-off 100% of immediate family office visits. However, if we must send items to another facility, such as a reference lab, the employee is responsible for the charge incurred and should pay the company directly. Immediate family consists of spouse and children up to age 21 or until married. Employees are required to set an appointment so as to not disrupt the overall schedule of the office.</p>
