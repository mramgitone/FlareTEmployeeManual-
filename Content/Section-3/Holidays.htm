        <h1>Holidays</h1>
        <p>The following will be observed as paid holidays: <MadCap:variable name="TimePeriods.Paid Company Holidays" />.</p>
        <p>Each holiday will be compensated using the employee’s hourly pay rate at eight (8) hours for full-time employees, plus holiday pay. Part-time, temporary, and supplemental employees, and employees on leave of absence or suspension are not eligible for holiday pay.</p>
        <p>To receive holiday pay, you must work both the scheduled workday prior to and the scheduled workday following the holiday, unless you have your supervisor permission not to work.</p>
        <p>Holidays are not included as “hours worked” for purposes of calculating overtime pay. If a holiday falls during your scheduled vacation period, the day will be counted as a holiday, rather than a vacation day. Holidays falling on a Saturday or Sunday may be celebrated on Friday or Monday, at the company’s discretion.</p>
        <p>The company recognizes that some employees may wish to observe certain days, as periods of worship or commemoration, that are not included in the company’s holiday schedule. Employees who would like to take a day off for such reasons may be permitted to do so if the employee’s absence from work will not result is an undue hardship in the operation of the company’s business and if prior approval has been obtained from the employee’s supervisor. Employees may use their paid vacation on such occasions, or they may take such time off as an unpaid, excused absence.</p>
