        <h1>Short-Term Disability Benefits</h1>
        <p>If you become disabled because of a non-occupational illness or injury and cannot work, you may be eligible for Short-Term Disability (STD). STD benefits help replace a portion of your lost income. Your STD benefits will be reduced by the amount of other income benefits you receive while disabled. Please consult the Summary of Benefits documentation, which can be obtained from <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" />.</p>
