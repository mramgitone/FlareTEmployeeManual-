        <h1>Vacation</h1>
        <p>Paid vacation is provided to full-time employees to allow a reasonable period of time to be free of job responsibilities and to enjoy rest and relaxation. Vacation will be compensated using the employee’s hourly pay rate at eight (8) hours per day.</p>
        <p>Vacation is accrued and earned on the anniversary date of each employee’s most recent date of hire and is based on an employee’s length of full-time services:</p>

        <p>Employees do not accrue and are not entitled to vacation time during the first year of employment. Beginning in the second year of employment, employees may take vacation earned on the previous anniversary date. Employees may not take vacation time that has not been earned, without approval of the Vice President of <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" />.</p>
        <p>Vacation not used within one year of the date on which it is earned cannot be carried forward and will result in forfeiture, unless state law requires otherwise.</p>
        <p>Paid vacations normally must be taken in the vacation year in which it accrues, except that an employee may carry over up to forty (40) hours of unused paid vacation for six (6) months into the next vacation year. Employees will not be paid for any unused vacation, except as required by law.</p>
        <p>All requests for vacation must be submitted no later than January 31 of each year, and such vacations will be granted based upon work schedules and length of service date. Employees returning from a leave of absence must wait at least four (4) weeks before taking vacation time unless staffing and scheduling needs allow earlier vacation to be taken.</p>
        <p>All employees are to take vacation time in weekly increments, unless other increments are approved by <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" />. However, vacation time taken may not exceed two (2) consecutive weeks at any one time. Employees that accrue more than two (2) weeks vacation may schedule the balance of their vacation in discretionary increments as approved by their supervisor. Accrued vacation will be applied to any unpaid leave of absence, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable state or federal law. However, any vacation pay used while on a leave of absence, regardless of the reason for the leave, cannot exceed the amount of vacation time the employee has actually accrued, but not used, at the beginning of the leave period. If you are absent from work due to an on-the job injury, you will continue to accrue vacation during the leave of absence, subject to applicable federal and state laws.</p>
        <p>Vacation is a time for employees to rest, relax, and pursue special interests. Therefore, pay will not be given in lieu of taking a vacation.</p>
        <p>When you leave your employment at <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />, you will be paid for any unused vacation earned through the last anniversary date. Any vacation time taken in excess of the amount earned will be treated as an advance of wages. If the employee leaves his or her employment, voluntarily or involuntarily, prior to earning the vacation time on his or her anniversary date, an amount equal to the hours taken in excess of those earned at the employee’s current hourly rate will be withheld from the employee’s final paycheck.</p>
