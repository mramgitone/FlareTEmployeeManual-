        <h1>Employee Assistance Program</h1>
        <p>At some time, most of us experience problems in our lives such as family or marital diﬃculties, problems with alcohol or drug abuse, emotional illness, ﬁnancial or legal worries, or diﬃculties with stress on the job. <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> oﬀers a free, conﬁdential Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to help employees deal with personal problems before they result in deterioration of health, family life, or job performance.</p>
        <p>The EAP covers all employees and extends to spouses and other dependents in the immediate household. It oﬀers assessment, short-term counseling, and referral for personal problems of employees or family members. EAP also oﬀers work/life referral services for child care, adoption, elder care resources, college planning and private school resources, health and wellness resources, preventive medicine, pet services, and other convenience services.</p>
        <p>Individuals who access EAP services will have the opportunity to speak openly and conﬁdentially with an EAP counselor who will help to assess and deﬁne the problem, oﬀer support and understanding, and give professional guidance and referral.</p>
        <p>Appointments can be made with EAP counselors who have regular oﬃce hours during the work week. Employees may see a counselor during their lunch hour or before or after work. However, if the appointment is made during working hours, the employee must use personal leave.</p>
        <p>You can contact EAP by telephone at 1-555-555-555, TTY 555-555-5TDD, or via e-mail at xyz@mail.com.</p>
