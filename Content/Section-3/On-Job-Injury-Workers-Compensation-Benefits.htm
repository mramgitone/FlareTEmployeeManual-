        <h1>On-the-Job Injury/Workers’ Compensation Benefits</h1>
        <p>Any employee reporting an on-the-job injury or illness will receive immediate and appropriate medical treatment. All applicable federal, state, and local laws or regulations pertaining to occupational injuries or illnesses will be followed at all times.</p>
        <p>It is the responsibility of all employees to report immediately to their supervisor all on-the-job injuries or illnesses regardless of how insignificant or minor the injury or illness may appear at the time. The employee’s personal physician must be notified immediately. If it is necessary for the employee to be seen by the doctor or go to the hospital, a family member will be called to transport the employee to the appropriate facility. <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />’s employees will not be responsible for transportation of another employee due to liabilities that may occur.</p>
        <p>When employees sustain an injury or illness that requires outside medical treatment or is involved in an accident that results in significant property damage, the employees may also be subject to a screening for the presence of drugs and/or alcohol in their system, provided state law permits these tests. Any employee who refuses screening for the presence of drugs and/or alcohol will be subject to immediate termination.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> provides either on-the-job injury benefits or worker’s compensation coverage for employees who have been injured on the job or who have sustained an occupational illness. Every employee who is injured on the job should report the injury immediately to his or her supervisor and submit to a drug and alcohol test. The supervisor will complete an Employee Incident Investigation Report, arrange an alcohol and substance abuse test, and coordinate with the Safety Department to complete necessary paperwork to apply for either on-the-job injury or worker’s compensation benefits.</p>
        <p>A physician’s “return to work” notice may be required.</p>
