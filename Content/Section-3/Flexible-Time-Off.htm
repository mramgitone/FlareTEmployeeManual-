        <h1>Flexible Time Off</h1>
        <p>Full time employees are eligible to accrue flexible time off (FTO) during the first full pay period. The FTO accrual rate is based on your length of employment, as follows:</p>

        <p>FTO cannot interfere with your departmentâ€™s operation and, therefore, must be approved by your supervisor at least two (2) weeks in advance, when possible. If FTO is used for employee illness, employees should notify their supervisor as soon as possible. Exempt employees must use FTO in full-day increments. Non-exempt hourly employees must use FTO in 4-hour increments.</p>
        <p>You may not receive advance FTO pay (for FTO time taken in excess of your FTO accrual balance). If non-exempt employees request and receive FTO leave in excess of their FTO balance, they will be docked for any excess hours or days taken in excess of their accrued FTO. Exempt employees shall not be docked pay for any partial day absences in the event that they exhaust their FTO leave.</p>
        <p>If you are on an approved leave of absence (such as a medical leave of absence) for less than thirty (30) days, your FTO accrual will not be affected; should the leave extend beyond thirty (30) days, FTO time will not continue to accrue.</p>
        <p>If a company paid holiday falls during your scheduled FTO period, you will be paid for the holiday and the holiday will not be counted as a FTO day.</p>
