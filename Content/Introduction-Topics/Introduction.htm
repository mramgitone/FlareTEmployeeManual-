        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This manual is designed to acquaint you with <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> and to provide you with information about working conditions, employee compensation and benefits, and some of the policies affecting your employment. <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> is an “at-will” employer, and nothing in this handbook constitutes a contract or guarantee of employment. You should read and understand all provisions of this manual. No employee manual can anticipate every circumstance or question that may arise, and as <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> grows, the policies may need to be changed. As a result, <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> reserves the right to revise, supplement, or rescind any policy or portion of this manual, as it deems appropriate. These changes may be communicated to you verbally, in writing, or via future revisions to the manual.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions, please contact your manager.</p>
