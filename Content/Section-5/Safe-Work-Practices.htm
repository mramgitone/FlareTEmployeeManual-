        <h1>Safe Work Practices</h1>
        <p>All employees are expected to work safely. Unsafe work practices will not be tolerated. A vital part of our continued success depends on how safely we work together as a team. Each of us is responsible for observing safe work practices. This includes wearing protective clothing, footwear, eyewear, earplugs, etc., as working conditions may require. It includes maintaining a clean and orderly environment. It includes familiarizing ourselves with all printed and posted material concerning workplace safety before we attempt a task.</p>
        <p>Another aspect of safe work practices concerns proper maintenance and use of tools and equipment. Each of us is responsible for making sure we know how to properly use the equipment we handle during work. Do not attempt to use any tool or piece of equipment unless you know how to do so safely and properly. Check the condition of the tools and equipment you use at the beginning of your shift every day. Do not attempt to use damaged, broken, or improperly adjusted or calibrated tools and equipment. Such tools and equipment should immediately be taken out of service and reported to your supervisor.</p>
        <p>If your assignment involves the use of hazardous or toxic materials, you must comply with all laws, rules, and regulations concerning their safe handling and disposal, as published by the company and governmental agencies having jurisdiction over such matters. Consult your supervisor for full details, including Material Safety Data Sheets, container labeling, and training that includes information regarding exposure to and handling of such materials.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions concerning safe work practices, ask your supervisor for assistance. If you observe any unsafe work practices, notify your supervisor immediately. If you discover tools or equipment, which do not appear to be in proper working order, report it to your supervisor immediately. If you are injured on the job, contact your supervisor immediately to report the injury and submit to the required drug and alcohol testing.</p>
        <p>Employees should become familiar with the emergency exits and evacuation procedures for the facility.</p>
