        <p>On behalf of your co-workers at <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />, we welcome you to our company and wish you every success as an employee of <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />. We are glad you have chosen to be a member of our team. We believe that each employee contributes to our growth and success and, in turn, <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> wishes to provide maximum opportunity and incentive for the growth and well-being of all our employees and their families.</p>
        <p>This handbook was developed to describe some of our expectations and to outline employment policies, programs, and benefits available to eligible employees. We hope that this manual is, and will continue to be, helpful to you so that you will have a better understanding of <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />â€™s philosophy, what we stand for, and the way we operate. You should familiarize yourself with the contents provided here as soon as possible and direct any questions you may have to your manager, terminal manager, or <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" />.</p>
        <p>In general, employees should raise concerns and questions with their manager. However, if an employee believes the matter should be discussed directly with <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" /> without first discussing the matter with the manager, that employee may do so.</p>
        <p>In the event a satisfactory solution cannot be reached after an employee has discussed the matter with his her manager and/or <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" />, any one of the three may involve higher levels of management to reach a solution. Under no circumstances will <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> tolerate retaliation against an employee who has raised a concern.</p>
        <p>Our growth as a company and as individuals depends upon adherence to these guidelines, as well as respect for and cooperation with one another. We look forward to having you as a part of our team.</p>
