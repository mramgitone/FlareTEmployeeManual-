        <h1>Reductions in Force</h1>
        <p>Occasionally, there will be a workforce adjustment that affects our staffing needs. An adjustment may result in a reduction of hours, a change in position, a change in shift, or termination. A change in position may occur within a work group when an employee from one department is moved to another department.</p>
        <p>When there is a need to decrease the number employed, the determining factors will be based on management’s needs under the particular circumstances. The following procedure will generally be applied: Employees under formal corrective action will be terminated or rolled back first. Next, temporary employees and those in their introductory period are laid off.</p>
        <p>Whenever it becomes necessary to decrease the work force permanently, the following factors shall be weighed in determining the selection of those employees to be retained: Demonstrated skill and efficiency in performing the particular work available and seniority. When demonstrated skill and efficiency in performing the particular work available are relatively equal between two or more employees, seniority shall be the determining factor.</p>
        <p>For temporary layoffs—those anticipated to last thirty (30) days or less—seniority shall be the factor in determining which employees shall be retained, provided the employees have clearly demonstrated their ability to perform all phases of the job and have a satisfactory performance and attendance record.</p>
        <p>If the company changes your position, you will retain your company length of service date for work group changes. If you are displaced due to a workforce adjustment and are not in corrective action, you may apply for any open position that you are qualified to perform. If you are terminated due to a workforce adjustment but return to <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> as either a full-time or part-time employee within ninety (90) days, you will retain your company length of service.</p>
        <p>If you voluntarily terminate your employment with <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> and subsequently return to work for the company, you will be given a new length of service date. Any time accrued during your prior employment with the company will not be included in your new length of service date.</p>
