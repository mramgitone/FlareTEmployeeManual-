        <h1>Pay Grade Reallocation</h1>
        <p>To determine whether a job class is allocated to the appropriate pay grade, <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" /> conducts market pay studies and regrade review requests. Requests for regrades are submitted in conjunction with each department’s budget submission. The review may result in a class retaining its present pay grade assignment or being assigned a higher or lower pay grade, subject to approval by management.</p>
        <p>The process of determining the appropriate grade for each class includes, but is not limited to, a review of prevailing pay rates for comparable jobs with other public and private employers in the appropriate job market area, internal alignment with closely related classes, and/or recruitment and retention diﬃculties. A regrade action aﬀects all company positions assigned to the job class being regraded.</p>
