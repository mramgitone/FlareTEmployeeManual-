        <h1>Deferred Retirement Option Program</h1>
        <p>The Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP) provides the ability for an employee to retire for purposes of the pension plan, while continuing to work and receive a salary for a period of three (3) years. During the DROP period, the pension plan accumulates the accrued monthly beneﬁt into an account balance identiﬁed as belonging to the member. When the employee terminates, he or she will choose from several distribution options for receipt of the DROP account balance.</p>
