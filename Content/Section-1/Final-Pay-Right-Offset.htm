        <h1>Final Pay and Right of Offset</h1>
        <p>If you resign or are terminated, your final pay, whether by check or direct deposit, will be available to you on the next regularly scheduled payday (unless other arrangements have been made). All company property must be returned to your manager at the time your final check is released to you. To the extent allowed by law, any amounts owed to the company or the monetary value of any unreturned company property will be deducted from the employee's final paycheck. Any employee who has engaged in misconduct, such as intentional or deliberate conduct that causes injury, damage, or loss to the company, will have the monetary amount of any injury, damage, or loss as determined by the company offset from any final check and/or payment of accrued but unused vacation. To the extent the final paycheck is not enough to satisfy the amounts owed to the company by you, you agree to immediately pay such amount to <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />.</p>
