        <h1>Length of Service</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> recognizes and rewards long-term employment with the company. For this reason, as your length of service with the company increases, you will receive preferential considerations in the granting of some employee benefits, such as vacation and when employment decisions are made, such as transfers and adjustments in work force.</p>
        <p>Your length of service date will be defined within your work groups and company-wide. The work groups are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pick-Up &amp; Delivery (P&amp;D) group, including P&amp;D drivers at each location.</li>
            <li>Freight group, including dock workers, unloaders, and spotters at each location.</li>
            <li>Line group, including line drivers in all locations.</li>
            <li>Maintenance group, including mechanics, tire men, and repairmen at each location.</li>
            <li>Office group, including clerical, administrative, and managerial employees at each location.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Effect of Transfers –</b> If you transfer to a new job <i>at the company’s request</i>, there is no effect on your company length of service. However, if you transfer to a new work group <i>on your own initiative</i>, your length of service may be affected.</p>
        <p><b>Vacation Time</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you transfer to a new work group on your own initiative and are in the P&amp;D, Freight, Maintenance, or Office work group, your company length of service rights, as they apply to scheduling vacations, are temporarily suspended for six (6) months.</li>
            <li>If you transfer into the Line Work group on your own initiative, company length of service rights, as they apply to scheduling vacation, are temporarily suspended until the next vacation rebidding process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In either event, you may schedule vacations with manager approval even though company length of service rights are suspended.</p>
        <p><b>Work and Vehicle/Equipment Assignment</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In groups where work assignments (start time, shift preference, route selection, or runs) or assignment of vehicles and equipment are subject to bidding, the date you transfer into that work group establishes your group length of service for bidding purposes.</li>
            <li>If you are in the Line work group and transfer to a new location on your own initiative, work group length of service rights are temporarily suspended for six (6) months, as it applies to run assignments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Workforce Adjustment</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Should a workforce adjustment be necessary, your length of service accumulated at the location, not with the company, will be considered during a workforce adjustment.</li>
        </ul>
