        <h1>Employment of Relatives</h1>
        <p>For purposes of this policy, relatives include any employee’s spouse, child, parent, sibling (brother or sister), grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, in-laws (parent or sibling), and step-relations (parent, child, or sibling). Relatives are permitted to work in the same terminal, department, or work location, but are not permitted to directly supervise other relatives. Additionally, no relative may discipline another relative.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" /> will review each employment relationship wherein one relative supervises another to evaluate whether a preexisting employment relationship between relatives will be permitted to continue under this policy. Coaching, disciplinary actions, and termination from employment of a relative should be conducted by, or directly involve, one level of management above the decision-making relative. The next two levels of management above the decision-making relative must sign performance reviews of a relative. No relative of an employee who appears before a termination review board may sit on the board or review the board’s decision.</p>
        <p>If you should become related to another employee, through marriage or adoption, while employed at <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />, please notify <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" /> so that the affected managers can be advised and assisted in adhering to this policy. <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" /> must authorize the employment of any relative of a management employee in writing.</p>
        <p>Any complaints concerning favoritism toward a relative should be reported to <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" />.</p>
