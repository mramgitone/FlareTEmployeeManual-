        <h1>Introductory Period</h1>
        <p>New employees are subject to an introductory period of <MadCap:variable name="TimePeriods.New Employee Introductory Period" />. This gives a new employee and <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> an opportunity to evaluate the employee's interest in the job and the ability to perform the work.</p>
        <p>If at any time your work is unsatisfactory or you do not appear to be suited to the position, your status will be reviewed with you by your manager. Upon completion of the introductory period, the company will review your performance. If the company finds your performance satisfactory and decides to continue your employment (subject to termination at any time and for any reason), it will advise you of any improvements expected from you.</p>
        <p>Upon satisfactory completion of the probationary period, a review will be given and benefits will begin as appropriate. All employees, regardless of classification or length of service, are expected to meet and maintain <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> standards for job performance and behavior.</p>
        <p>Completion of the introductory period or continuation of employment after the introductory period does not entitle you to remain employed by the company for any definite period of time. Both you and <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> are free to terminate the employment relationship, at any time, with or without notice, and for any reason not expressly prohibited by law.</p>
