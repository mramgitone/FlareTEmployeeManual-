        <h1>New Employee Orientation</h1>
        <p>Orientation is a formal welcoming process that is designed to make the new employee feel comfortable, informed about the company, and prepared for his or her position. New employee orientation is conducted by <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" /> and includes an overview of the company history and an explanation of the company core values, vision, mission, goals, and objectives. In addition, the new employee will be given an overview of benefits, tax, and legal issues and complete any necessary paperwork.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> employees may be issued an alarm code and keys to enter and exit their work location after hours. It is important that you do not write or affix your name or the companyâ€™s name on the keys/card. If they get lost, others could have access to our facility. You are responsible for not lending your keys, codes, or access card for use by other employees or non-employees. Loaning or allowing another employee to use your keys, code, or access card may lead to disciplinary action up to and including termination. If you lose your access card, please report the loss promptly to your manager in order to ensure that the total security of our facility is maintained. It is also your responsibility to report to the office coordinator any person you see in the building who is not an employee.</p>
