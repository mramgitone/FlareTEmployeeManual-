        <h1>Prohibitions Regarding Future Employment Activities</h1>
        <p>For one (1) year after your employment with <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> ends, you cannot be involved in certain activities in your subsequent employment. You may not assist anyone for remuneration with respect to any proceeding, application, case, contract, or other matter you personally or substantially participated in while in <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> service if your participation as an employee of <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> involved a decision, approval, or recommendation with respect to the matter. However, these provisions do not restrict a former <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> employee who was laid oï¬€ because of the award of a privatization contract from accepting employment with the contractor who is awarded the contract, unless he or she was involved personally and substantially in the selection of the contractor. Employees with questions on these restrictions should contact <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" />.</p>
