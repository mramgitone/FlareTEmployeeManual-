        <h1>Reasonable Accommodation of Disability</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> does not discriminate against any applicant or employee in hiring or in the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment due to physical or mental disability. When <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> becomes aware of any disability that prevents an otherwise qualified applicant or employee from performing a job, the company will assess whether any reasonable accommodation would allow the person to perform the job before refusing employment or making a distinction in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of the disability. An accommodation that creates an undue hardship on the company or which endangers health or safety is not a reasonable accommodation. The company will make any reasonable accommodation necessary to allow an otherwise qualified applicant or employee to perform the job.</p>
        <p>An otherwise qualified applicant for employment or an employee with a disability who requires reasonable accommodation may inform his or her manager of the nature of the disability and the accommodation required. Employees with access to such information shall maintain the confidentiality of the information to the extent reasonably possible and shall not release the information to anyone who does not have the right or need to know.</p>
