        <h1>“At-Will” Employment</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> is an “at-will” employer. Employment at <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> is at-will for an indefinite period of time until terminated by either the employee or the company, with or without cause. That means that either party may end the relationship. Nothing in this handbook constitutes a contract or guarantee of employment. Management reserves the right to modify, revoke, or replace any policies and procedures at any time. All policies and procedures are subject to applicable federal and state laws.</p>
        <p>No oral or written representation by <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> personnel will create a contract of employment. No employment practice of <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> is intended to create a contract of employment. No changes in <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />’s employment-at-will policy will be effective unless executed in writing and signed by the company President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
