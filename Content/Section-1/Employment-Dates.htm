        <h1>Employment Dates</h1>
        <p>Three different employment dates are used to calculate your eligibility for various benefits:</p>
        <p><b>Hire Date –</b> The original date you were hired by <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />.</p>
        <p><b>Length of Service Date –</b> A revised hire date, which reflects a change from part-time to full-time employment, a leave of absence lasting more than ninety (90) days, or the rehire of a former employee.</p>
        <p><b>Vesting Date –</b> The total amount of time an employee has worked for <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> in a full-time capacity, which has been adjusted for breaks in service, provided the employee has worked for a longer period of time than he or she was separated from the company. This date is used to calculate the employee’s vested portion of the employer matching contribution made to the employee’s 401 (k) Savings Plan. An employee vests 20% of matching contributions for each year of employment and is 100% vested after five (5) years.</p>
