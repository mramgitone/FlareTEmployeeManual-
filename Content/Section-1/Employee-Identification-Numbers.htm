        <h1>Employee Identification Numbers</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> assigns every new employee an Employee Identiﬁcation Number (EIN). This six-digit number is randomly-generated and is permanently assigned to that employee. Employees will use their EIN to enter their hours in <MadCap:variable name="ProductsToolsDocs.Time Tracking Software" /> and to complete many company forms. A Social Security number (SSN) is required for the new hire process, on tax forms, and for other legal and ﬁnancial documents, but some forms have been modiﬁed to replace SSN with EIN as much as possible. Payroll contacts in the departments also use the EIN as each employee’s unique identiﬁer.</p>
