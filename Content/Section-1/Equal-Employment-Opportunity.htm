        <h1>Equal Employment Opportunity</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> is committed to a policy of equal employment opportunity. This applies to all areas of employment, including recruitment, selection, hiring, training, transfer, promotion, termination, compensation, and benefits. This means that employment decisions affecting applicants and employees will not be based upon an individualâ€™s race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, or any other unlawful basis. Employees who engage in unlawful discrimination will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. If you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against, you should notify your manager, terminal manager, <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" />, or any other person in management whom you are comfortable in approaching.</p>
