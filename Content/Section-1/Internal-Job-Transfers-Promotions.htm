        <h1>Internal Job Transfers and Promotions</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> wants to provide current employees with every opportunity to transfer and be promoted to jobs for which they are qualified in the company. Job openings are posted via bulletin boards and our website. If you are interested in being considered for another job or work location, let your manager know of your interest. Jobs will be filled with the best-qualified candidates. If there are equally qualified applicants, priority will go to current employees from the work location where the vacancy exists, followed by current employees from other locations. However, <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> reserves the right to fill open positions from outside the company when it feels that better qualified applicants are available.</p>
        <p>Employees who are on a formal corrective action or who are on written notice under the Attendance Policy are not eligible to be considered for promotion or transfer.</p>
