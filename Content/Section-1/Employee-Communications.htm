        <h1>Employee Communications</h1>
        <p>Two-way communications between you and <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> are important in developing successful and productive working relationships. These communications occur in a variety of ways.</p>
        <p><b>Open Door Policy –</b> The door is always open if you have suggestions for improvement, questions or concerns, or any work-related problem or issue. In most cases, you should meet with your manager first, as he or she knows you best, and is probably in the best position to address your concerns. If, however, you are unable to reach a satisfactory solution, or do not feel comfortable going to your manager, you can proceed to the next level of management or to anyone else in management with whom you feel comfortable, including <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" />.</p>
        <p><b>Meetings –</b> Safety meetings may be regularly scheduled for all work groups. General meetings may be held periodically, giving you an opportunity to hear about new developments, express your opinions, and ask questions.</p>
        <p><b>Current Address Policy – </b><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> requests that employees provide their current address to the company. Important information may be mailed directly to your home address. In such instances, mail will be sent to the address on file with <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" />. If your current address changes, please advise the company, so that you will not miss important mailings.</p>
        <p><b>Bulletin Boards – </b><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> uses bulletin boards to communicate important business information such as safety rules, statutory and legal notices, company policies, and management memos. Each employee has the responsibility to read the information that is posted. Employees may not post material on bulletin boards without the approval of their manager.</p>
