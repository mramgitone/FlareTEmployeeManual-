        <h1>Position Descriptions</h1>
        <p>Each employee is assigned to a speciﬁc position. Each position has an oﬃcial description outlining the duties an employee in that position is expected to perform. The position description is the basis for assigning your position to a job classiﬁcation. Each job classiﬁcation is assigned to a pay grade that determines your pay range. Ask your manager for a copy of your position description.</p>
        <p>When your duties change signiﬁcantly, your position description should be updated accordingly, and a copy provided to <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" />.</p>
