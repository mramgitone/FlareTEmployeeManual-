        <h1>Employment Outside the Company</h1>
        <p>Any employee of <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> must advise his or her manager in writing of any outside employment for which the employee receives compensation on either a salary or fee basis. The notification shall include a brief description of the work performed and the approximate number of hours per week devoted to it. Nothing in this requirement shall be construed to prohibit such employment, unless it interferes with the employee’s performance of his or her job duties and responsibilities with the company, or if the nature of the outside employment is deemed to have a negative impact on the company or creates a conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>If the company determines that an employee’s outside employment interferes with performance or the ability to meet the requirements of the company, as may be modified from time to time, or the outside employment is deemed to have a negative impact or creates a conflict of interest, the employee may be asked to terminate the outside employment if he or she wishes to remain employed at <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />.</p>
        <p>The company’s office space, equipment, and materials are not to be used for outside employment.</p>
