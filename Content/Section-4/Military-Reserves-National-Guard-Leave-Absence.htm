        <h1>Military Reserves/National Guard Leave of Absence</h1>
        <p>If you serve in U.S. military organizations or state militia groups, you may take the necessary time off to fulfill this obligation and will retain all your legal rights for continued employment under existing laws. Upon presentation of satisfactory military pay verification data, you will be paid the difference between your normal base compensation and the pay (excluding expense pay) received while on military duty. The portion of any military leaves of absence in excess of two (2) weeks will be unpaid. For this excess time, you may use any available accrued FTO/vacation for the absence, but you are not obligated to do so.</p>
        <p>If your leave is extended for more than thirty (30) days, FTO/vacation and other benefits will not continue to accrue.</p>
        <p>If you are on two (2)-week active duty training assignments or inactive duty training drills, you are required to return to work for the first regularly scheduled shift after the training, allowing reasonable travel time. For longer military leave, you must apply for re-employment in accordance with all applicable state and federal laws. Every reasonable effort will be made to return you to your previous position or a comparable one.</p>
        <p>You are expected to notify your supervisor as soon as you are aware of the dates you will be on duty so that arrangements can be made for replacement during this absence.</p>
