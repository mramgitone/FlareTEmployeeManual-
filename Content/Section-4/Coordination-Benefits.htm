        <h1>Coordination of Benefits</h1>
        <p>A leave of absence for a disability will be coordinated with workers' compensation, short-term and long-term disability if applicable, and any other benefits provided to the employee to minimize the impact of the leave of absence for both the employee and the company. Health and other insurance benefits ordinarily provided by the employer and for which the employee is otherwise eligible will be continued during the period of the leave if the employee elects to continue paying his or her share of the premiums for such coverage. The cost of dependent coverage normally borne by the employee will remain the sole responsibility of the employee. The employee should make arrangements with <MadCap:variable name="DepartmentsPeople.Human Resources" /> to pay the cost of such coverage before the leave begins.</p>
