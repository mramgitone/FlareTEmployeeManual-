        <h1>Intermittent or Reduced Leave Schedules</h1>
        <p>Under certain conditions, <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> may allow you to take intermittent leave or work on a reduced schedule. “Intermittent leave” is leave taken in separate blocks of time rather than one continuous period of time. It may range from an hour or more to several weeks. The company may allow intermittent leave to be taken on an occasional basis for medical appointments or leave taken several days at a time spread over a period of months.</p>
        <p>A “reduced leave schedule” is one that reduces the usual number of hours/days per workweek or hours per workday. It could include a schedule of a three (3)-day week or working only mornings or afternoons to meet your requirements. When requesting intermittent leave, you are requested to cooperate with your supervisor to find a mutually agreeable time for the leave.</p>
        <p>The company does not set a limit on the size of an increment of leave for an intermittent or reduced leave schedule. This type of leave will not reduce the total amount of leave available to an employee. Only the time actually taken is charged against the employee’s entitlement to twelve (12) weeks of leave.</p>
