        <h1>Communications during Leave</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> may contact you about every thirty (30) days while you are on leave to check on your status and your intention to return to work. The company may request medical recertification for any of the following reasons:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You request a leave extension.</li>
            <li>Circumstances described by the original certification have changed significantly.</li>
            <li>The company receives information that casts doubt upon the continuing validity of the certification.</li>
            <li>You are unable to return to work after leave because of the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If at any time you give an unequivocal notice that you will not be returning to work, the company will request a written resignation. The companyâ€™s obligation to maintain health benefits and to restore you to your prior position ends at that point.</p>
