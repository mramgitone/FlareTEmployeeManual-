        <h1>When Restoration Rights are Denied</h1>
        <p>There are four reasons why you may not be restored to your former positions at the end of leave:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You cannot perform the essential functions of the former position, with or without accommodation.</li>
            <li>You would pose a significant risk to the safety of other employees.</li>
            <li>Your position was eliminated or you were laid off because of business conditions.</li>
            <li>You were identified as a “key” employee and informed of this designation before or during the leave. Your return to the former position would represent an economic hardship for the company.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you have any questions about this policy or your rights and responsibilities, please contact your supervisor.</p>
