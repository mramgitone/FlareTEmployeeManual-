        <h1>Restoration to Prior Position</h1>
        <p>On return from leave, <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> may restore you to the position you held when the leave began or to an equivalent position, with equivalent benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. You have no right, however, to be returned to the same position. An equivalent position will involve the same or substantially similar duties and responsibilities and will include substantially equivalent skill, effort, responsibility, and authority.</p>
        <p>You are also entitled to be returned to the same shift or equivalent schedule and will have the same opportunity for bonuses and other non-discretionary payments.</p>
        <p>If special qualifications are required for the position, and they have lapsed during your leave, you will be given a reasonable opportunity to fulfill the requirements after returning to work.</p>
