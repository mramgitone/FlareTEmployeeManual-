        <h1>Employee Transfer</h1>
        <p>If you select intermittent leave or a reduced work schedule, <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> has the right to transfer you to a job that is more suitable to recurring periods of leave. There are two conditions for this transfer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The equivalent position must have equivalent pay and benefits, but it does not have to have equivalent duties. Equivalent pay is defined as equal “hourly rate.” Therefore, you may receive the same hourly wages, but based upon the intermittent leave or reduced work schedule, you may receive less wages per pay period.</li>
            <li>You must be qualified to perform the job.</li>
        </ul>
